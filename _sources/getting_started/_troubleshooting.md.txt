Note that `bsyn` imports all `bpy` functionality, so you can call any `bpy` function as if you would normally.

If any issues with the Blender scripts not having the correct modules, try `bsyn.fix_blender_modules()`, or to completely reconfigure Blender, `bsyn.fix_blender_install()`. If installing from local clone, use `local=True` argument to both. If you are making changes to the local clone, use `editable=True` to install in editable mode.
