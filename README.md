Synthetic Blender pipeline - aimed at generating large synthetic datasets.

BlenderProc is an incredibly useful tool for synthetic dataset generation. We aim here to provide an alternative that is (a) more specialised for uncommon data forms, and (b) runs faster for creating large scale datasets.

We produce support for:
- Custom Shader AOVs (eg. UVs, Normals, etc.)
- Multi-threading support
- Efficient run-speed

## Installation

1) Install Blender
2) `python setup.py install`

## Quickstart

For a quick overview of creating a render: `examples/quickstart.py`

For an overview of creating a dataset: `examples/dataset_creation`

## Benchmarking

We show significant speed improvements over BlenderProc
